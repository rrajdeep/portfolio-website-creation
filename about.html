    <!-- About me -->
    <p>
        Hello World! ðŸ‘‹ I am Rajdeep, an enginer by profession and a programmer by passion.
        I started my programming journey since my school but it got wings recently.
        Having worked as a Research & Development engineer and a Business Analyst for more
        than two years I decided to switch to programming and now I am web developer.
        It has provided a plateform to express my skills & creativity and use them to create
        exciting projects. I really enjoy creating things that reside on internet.
